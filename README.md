## Project Description
*Leaderboard Competition* evaluates several generative and descriptive classifiers against Kaggleâ€™s Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not. ![image](https://github.com/tahirbags/cs410_project_public/assets/144145146/03f6b1ec-afc7-423d-98ac-69baa1ecb7d6)

What is the type of your project: Is it Data Set Creation or Leaderboard Competition Creation? 
- Leaderboard Competition Creation

If your project is Data Set Creation, what is the novelty of your data set as compared with all the existing data sets? Which of the existing data sets is the closet to yours? What new task can your new data set be used to evaluate? How do you plan to create the data set? 
- N/A

If your project is Leaderboard Competition Creation, which data set do you plan to use? Do you have access to that data set?  What is the task that will be evaluated using the data set? How do you envision the participants will participate in the competition? 
- We plan on using the Natural Language Processing with disaster tweets dataset. The task that will be evaluated is to rank the accuracy of models created to process Twitter tweets related to disasters, and if they are real or not. Participants will compete by creating models to detect the truism of a tweet claiming disaster.
